# Test automation
Auto tests to verify the functionality of the login and registration.

For running test, you need IDE e.g. Eclipse or Intellij IDEA with installed Maven.

[Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/neon/)
[Eclipse maven plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/)

[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

Then clone project. It can be done in two ways:
  - by git pugin [Eclipse git plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/).
  Intellij IDEA has git already installed.
  - by download zip with this project, create new maven project in IDE and unpack zip into project folder.

Run project by JUnit test framework. 

For Eclipse: right click on project -> Run as -> JUnit Test
